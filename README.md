# project-villainy
This is the creation of a villain.

v is the new symbol for an evil statement.

v I will murder you because I am better than you are smarter than a rock.

Things can be said legally by using the V symbol as often as you can.

The seriousness of the statement is additional and meaning and purpose cannot be derived or supposed.

The reason for this project is to explore that by *saying words and phrases that you would never *say, you will *learn something.
