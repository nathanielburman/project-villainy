# project-villainy
This is the creation of a villain.

v is the new symbol for an evil statement.

v I will murder you because I am better than you are smarter than a rock.

Things can be said legally by using the V symbol as often as you can.

The seriousness of the statement is additional and meaning and purpose cannot be derived or supposed.

The reason for this project is to explore that by *saying words and phrases that you would never *say, you will *learn something.

If one builds up enough villainy data then evil can be better understood but it is from a distance since it is only being conjured with your words alone and no action.

If I am on the computer and type in "I will punch you in the face"; convert into "v I will punch you in the face". Then it is known that if i send the message to a person who is hundreds of miles away from me with no reason to travel to perfomr the action then the saying of the statement is nullified obviously. Therefore a person can say "v I will smash your face into the dust." if it can be easily assumed that there is no intention of actually doing it.

The creation of a villain needs protection if the villain is purly existing in words alone. I can creat such a villain. However a villain needs protection. The freedom of speech should legally provide the protection defacto, however existing as a villain requires protection.
